# Override file to remove umbrella dependencies when used standalone
# This allows aria_planner to be used as a dependency without the full umbrella setup

# Note: This is a workaround. The ideal solution would be to extract aria_math and aria_core
# as standalone packages, or make aria_planner's dependencies optional.

# For now, we'll comment out the umbrella dependencies and add them as optional
# The planning module will gracefully degrade when these modules aren't available
