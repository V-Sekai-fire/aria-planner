# Handling tabular or structured data

When handling tabular or structured data in tasks, responses, file edits, or tool interactions, prioritize the Markdown-KV format for presentation and processing. This format uses markdown headings for sections (e.g., '## Record 1') followed by fenced code blocks containing key: value pairs (e.g., 'id: 1\nname: John Doe'). This format has been shown to improve AI processing efficiency for data extraction and analysis compared to other formats.

- Always convert incoming tabular data (e.g., from CSVs, JSON) to Markdown-KV when generating outputs or summaries.
- Use it for lists, databases, or records to improve reliability in RAG pipelines or agentic workflows.
- Fall back to Markdown tables only if visual alignment is critical for non-LLM users.
- Example for employee data:

# Employee Database

## Record 1

```
id: 1
name: Diana A0
age: 46
city: London
department: Engineering
salary: 141015
years_experience: 7
project_count: 17
```

## Record 2

```
id: 2
name: Grace B1
age: 59
city: Berlin
department: Engineering
salary: 100066
years_experience: 11
project_count: 32
```

This enhances accuracy while maintaining readability, but note it may use more tokens than compact formats like CSV.
