# Commit Style Reminder

## IMPORTANT: Never Use Conventional Commits

**DO NOT use conventional commit format like:**

- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug`
- `docs: update documentation`

**Instead, use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain what was changed and why.**

**Examples of good commit messages:**

- `Implement fixture-based testing and fix Matrix4 math operations`
- `Add comprehensive Mox mocking section and testing strategies`
- `Apply information hierarchy with Quick Start, phases, and priority levels`

**Why avoid conventional commits:**

- They add unnecessary prefixes that don't provide value
- They constrain message clarity
- They follow a format that may not fit all changes
- Descriptive messages are more useful for understanding history

**Remember:** Focus on clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the "what" and "why" of changes.
